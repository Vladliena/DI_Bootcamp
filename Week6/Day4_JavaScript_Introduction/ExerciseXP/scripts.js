// üåü Exercise 1 : List Of People
// Instructions
// const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];


// Part I - Review About Arrays
// Write code to remove ‚ÄúGreg‚Äù from the people array.

// Write code to replace ‚ÄúJames‚Äù to ‚ÄúJason‚Äù.

// Write code to add your name to the end of the people array.

// Write code that console.logs Mary‚Äôs index.take a look at the indexOf method on Google.

// Write code to make a copy of the people array using the slice method.
// The copy should NOT include ‚ÄúMary‚Äù or your name.
//     Hint: remember that now the people array should look like this const people = ["Mary", "Devon", "Jason", "Yourname"];
// Hint: Check out the documentation for the slice method

// Write code that gives the index of ‚ÄúFoo‚Äù. Why does it return -1 ?

//     Create a variable called last which value is the last element of the array.
//         Hint: What is the relationship between the index of the last element in the array and the length of the array ?


// Part II - Loops
// Using a loop, iterate through the people array and console.log each person.

// Using a loop, iterate through the people array and exit the loop after you console.log ‚ÄúDevon‚Äù .
// Hint: take a look at the break statement in the lesson.


const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];

people.shift()
people[2] = 'Jason'
people.push('Vladlena')
console.log(`Mary's index `, people.indexOf('Mary'))

const peopleCopy = people.slice(1,4)
console.log(peopleCopy)
const fooIndex = people.indexOf('foo')
console.log(fooIndex) // always gives us -1 if there is no such element
const last = people[people.length-1]
console.log(last)

for (let i=0 ; i<people.length ; i++){
    console.log(people[i])
}

for (let i=0; i < people.length; i++){
    console.log(people[i])
    if (people[i] == 'Devon')
    break
}

// üåü Exercise 2 : Your Favorite Colors
// Instructions
// Create an array called colors where the value is a list of your five favorite colors.
// Loop through the array and as you loop console.log a string like so: ‚ÄúMy #1 choice is blue‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy #2 choice is red‚Äù ect‚Ä¶ .
// Bonus: Change it to console.log ‚ÄúMy 1st choice‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy 2nd choice‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy 3rd choice‚Äù, picking the correct suffix for each number.
//     Hint : create an array of suffixes to do the Bonus


const color = ['red','black','yellow','purple']
const suffixes = ['st','nd','rd','th']

for (let i=0;i<color.length;i++){
    console.log(`My ${i+1}${suffixes[i]} choice is ${color[i]}`)
}

// üåü Exercise 3 : Repeat The Question
// Instructions
// Prompt the user for a number.
//     Hint : Check the data type you receive from the prompt(ie.Use the typeof method)

// While the number is smaller than 10 continue asking the user for a new number.
//     Tip : Which while loop is more relevant for this situation ?

do {
    userInput = prompt("Please enter a number greater than or equal to 10:");
} while (isNaN(userInput) || userInput < 10);


// üåü Exercise 4 : Building Management
// Instructions:
const building = {
    numberOfFloors: 4,
    numberOfAptByFloor: {
        firstFloor: 3,
        secondFloor: 4,
        thirdFloor: 9,
        fourthFloor: 2,
    },
    nameOfTenants: ["Sarah", "Dan", "David"],
    numberOfRoomsAndRent: {
        sarah: [3, 990],
        dan: [4, 1000],
        david: [1, 500],
    },
}

// Review About Objects
// Copy and paste the above object to your Javascript file.

//     Console.log the number of floors in the building.

//         Console.log how many apartments are on the floors 1 and 3.

// Console.log the name of the second tenant and the number of rooms he has in his apartment.

// Check if the sum of Sarah‚Äôs and David‚Äôs rent is bigger than Dan‚Äôs rent.If it is, than increase Dan‚Äôs rent to 1200.

console.log(building.numberOfFloors)
console.log(`First floor: ${building.numberOfAptByFloor.firstFloor}, Third floor: ${building.numberOfAptByFloor.thirdFloor}`)
console.log(building.nameOfTenants[1])
console.log(building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.dan[0])

if (building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.sarah[1] + building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.david[1] > building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.dan[0]){
    building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.dan[1] += 200
}

console.log(building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.dan[1])


// üåü Exercise 5 : Family
// Instructions
// Create an object called family with a few key value pairs.
// Using a for in loop, console.log the keys of the object.
// Using a for in loop, console.log the values of the object.

const family = {
    mom: 'Lera',
    dad: 'Pavel',
    daughter: 'Vlada',
    daughterHusband: 'Zeev'
}

for (let key in family){
    console.log(`${key}: ${family[key]}`)
}

// Exercise 6 : Rudolf
// Instructions
const details = {
    my: 'name',
    is: 'Rudolf',
    the: 'raindeer'
}
// Given the object above and using a for loop, console.log ‚Äúmy name is Rudolf the raindeer‚Äù

let sentence = ''
for (let key in details){
    sentence += `${key} ${details[key]} `
}

console.log(sentence)


// Exercise 7 : Secret Group
// Instructions
const names = ["Jack", "Philip", "Sarah", "Amanda", "Bernard", "Kyle"];
// A group of friends have decided to start a secret society.The society‚Äôs name will be the first letter of each of their names sorted in alphabetical order.
//     Hint: a string is an array of letters
// Console.log the name of their secret society.The output should be ‚ÄúABJKPS‚Äù

let secretSocietyName = names.map((name) => name[0]).sort().join('')
console.log(secretSocietyName)
